# Implementation of Common ML Algorithms From Scratch

This Repository contains basis implementations of commonly used ML algorithms from scratch. The files include:

1. kNN.ipynb: This Notebook contains a simple implementation of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm coded mainly using numpy and pandas for optimization. It includes time analysis on projected data for dimensionality reduction to see which value of k results in the best performance on the dimensionally reduced data and the original data.

2. ID3_DecisionTreeClassifier.ipynb: contains the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using the ID3 algorithm. All the functions for entropy and information gain used in the ID3 algorithm are written from scratch using numpy for optimization. There is a comparison of test errors before and after pruning of the ID3 algorithm. Pruning the tree results in a better test accuracy.
